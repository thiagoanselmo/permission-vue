## Permission Vue
> Permission Vue is an RBAC-based ACL design that can be used on Vue2 and Vue3.

The permission-vue project is ACL focused and does nothing more than check whether a user has access. All pre-ACL and post-ACL treatment will be done by the user.

You can use `permission-vue` to protect your routes and also within your components.

The permission-vue project makes use of the [permission-engine](https://github.com/thiagoanselmo/permission-engine) project, which is how we have to write ACL schemes to check user roles.

### Install permission-vue
1. npm install permission-vue --save
2. yarn add permission-vue

### Use `permission-vue`
The `permission-vue` package can be used in various ways, giving the developer a freedom to choose the way to use it according to his project.
Below we list the various ways to use the `permission-vue` package.

1. Adding an ACL instance to the Vue prototype
2. Using the management function.
3. Using management instance.
4. Using a global mixin in your app.
5. Using a local mixin in your app.



#### 1. Adding an ACL instance to the Vue prototype

```javascript
    //
    // Your file bootstrap application main.js
    //     
    import Vue from 'vue';
    import VuePermission from 'permission-vue';
    
    Vue.use(VuePermission);
    // add in Vue prototype `this.$acl`

    
    //
    // Your file beforeEach.js
    // 
    

```


### Class Error `ErrorPermissionACL` 

The `ErrorPermissionACL` class is used to check the errors generated by the `permission-vue` package within your code, so you can have different decisions made.

#### Mode use `ErrorPermissionACL`

```javascript
    import { ErrorPermissionACL, canAccess } from 'permission-vue'

    const userRoles = ['admin'];
    const roles = [{ $in: ['admin'] }]
    try {
      const hasAccess = canAccess(userRoles, roles);
       ...
      // Your code continue 
    } catch (ex) {
      if (ex instanceof ErrorPermissionACL) cosole.error(ex.message);
      else throw ex;
    }
    
```
